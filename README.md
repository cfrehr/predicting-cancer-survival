# Predicting Prostate Cancer Survival Rate

A hypothetical insurance company wants to score the survival of prostate cancer patients to determine their eligibility for post-diagnosis life insurance. Given a 31-D data set of randomly generated variables, I perform exploratory data analysis and build a predictive classifier.

# Solution Approach Outline

1. Get to know the data
* a. Understand the data from a practical/human point of view
* b. Brainstorm how variables may be related at an intuitive level
* c. Get a sense of what data may be most useful
2. Analyze the data
  a. Try to verify accuracy and reliability of data
  b. Explore the distributions of individual variables
  c. Experiment with data to uncover relationships between seemingly independent variables
  d. Visualize the data
  e. Determine which factors most strongly affect the class variable or those closely related to it
3. Process the data
  a. Think about which variables are worth imputing and which are best left alone
  b. Compute alternative measures
4. Conceptualize solution approach
5. Build solutions, test, rebuild, test, rebuild
