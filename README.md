# Predicting Prostate Cancer Survival Rate

Motivation
----------

A hypothetical insurance company wants to score the survival of prostate cancer patients to determine their eligibility for post-diagnosis life insurance. Given a 31-D data set of randomly generated variables, I perform exploratory data analysis and build a predictive classifier that can help an insurance company reduce their risk.

Solution Approach Outline
-------------------------

1) Get to know the data
* Understand the data from a practical/human point of view
* Brainstorm how variables may be related at an intuitive level
* Get a sense of what data may be most useful

2) Analyze the data
* Try to verify accuracy and reliability of data
* Explore the distributions of individual variables
* Experiment with data to uncover relationships between seemingly independent variables
* Visualize the data
* Determine which factors most strongly affect the class variable or those closely related to it

3) Process the data
* Think about which variables are worth imputing and which are best left alone
* Compute alternative measures

4) Conceptualize solution approach

5) Build models, test, evaluate, rebuild
